menu "LITMUS^RT"

config NP_SECTION
	bool "Non-preemptive section support"
	depends on !SPARC64
	default y
	help
	  Include support for flag-based non-preemptive section signaling
	  from userspace.

	  (currently broken on SPARC64)

	  Say Yes if in doubt.


config FMLP
	bool "FMLP support"
	depends on NP_SECTION
	default y
	help
	  Include support for deterministic multiprocessor real-time
	  synchronization support.

	  Say Yes if in doubt.


menu "Tracing"

config SCHED_TASK_TRACE
	bool "Trace real-time tasks"
	default y
	help
	  Include support for the sched_trace_XXX() tracing functions. This
          allows the collection of real-time task events such as job
	  completions, job releases, early completions, etc. This results in  a
	  small overhead in the scheduling code. Disable if the overhead is not
	  acceptable (e.g., benchmarking).

	  Say Yes for debugging.
	  Say No for overhead tracing.

config SCHED_DEBUG_TRACE
	bool "TRACE() debugging"
	default y
	help
	  Include support for sched_trace_log_messageg(), which is used to
	  implement TRACE(). If disabled, no TRACE() messages will be included
	  in the kernel, and no overheads due to debugging statements will be
	  incurred by the scheduler. Disable if the overhead is not acceptable
	  (e.g. benchmarking).

	  Say Yes for debugging.
	  Say No for overhead tracing.

config FEATHER_TRACE
	bool "Feather-Trace Instrumentation Support"
	default y
	help
	  Include Feather-Trace trace points. Currently not supported on
	  sparc64.

	  Say Yes for overhead tracing.
