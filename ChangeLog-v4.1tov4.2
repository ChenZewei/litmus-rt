Improovments on s5p hdmi stuff
memcopy from glibc
string from glibc
scheduler performance: if the user sets it up it will power up all the 4 cores on switcching, if the user switchs off this he'll try to shutdown.
Added the CONFIG_MALI_GPU_OVERCLOCK_533MHZ to the config
Reduced the time that MALI takes to changed frequencies from 1sec to 100msec.
Merge error in cpupower driver
RCU: Joe's RCU
mm.h: increase readahead value from 128kb to 2048kb
sched: don't call task_group() many times in set_task_rq() - Improves performance, better if autogroup is enabled.
ARM: SMP: use a timing out completion for cpu hotplug - from Russel King
Little trick on slub.c to get some performance
Add dynamic writeback feature from 3.1
Added optimized ARM RWSEM algorithm.
lib/sha1: use the git implementation of SHA-1 (10 to 15% faster boot times)
Remove ARM sha1 routines (as the update above make's it obsolet)
Prevent aliased requests from starving other I/O
I/O-less dirty throttling, reduce filesystem writeback from page reclaim - backport from 3.2
writeback: Add a 'reason' to wb_writeback_work
fs/sync.c: add module_param to enable/disable fsync() calls. Its enabled by default. Let me explain this a little more.
	- When you write something to disk either you just write and bye or you write and wait until the confirmation is made.
	- By default I left this enable as its the default. If you disable it you'll get more performance but (HUGE WARNING).
	- If you writed something to disk and you power off your board, you have a huge chance of data corruption. So, only turn this off if you can assure
	- that you will turn off your board properly.
Added support for XZ compressed kernels
Enabled XZ Support ;) 3Mbyte kernel now ;) 

--- BELOW ARM PATCH's from Vicent Guittot!!! --
ARM: 7011/1: Add ARM cpu topology definition
sched: Ensure cpu_power periodic update
ARM: topology: save cpu id of each core
ARM: topology: Update topology according to current sched_mc mode
ARM: 7182/1: ARM cpu topology: fix warning
ARM: topology: Add a cpu_power function
ARM: topology: Add a topology update notification
ARM: cpu topology: Add asym topology flag for using cpu0 1st
ARM: cpu topology: add debugfs
cpupower: update the cpu_power according to cpu load
sched: use cpu capacity to decide if a ILB is needed
-- END --


And least but not less important. Merged 3.0.42 ;)
